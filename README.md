datePicker-AngularJS-directive
=======================

AngularJs Directive, date picker, with no dependencies, plain JS.

Still in progress~ (I've still to define what should the behaviour be in some special use-cases. It is functional though! :D )

Usage: You simply pass a date value (this is the scope object that you will use) and done!
```html
<date-picker type="text" date-Value="newDate" />
```

You can navigate through month and years. You can also jump to today and select a date you wish to change to.

Pure Js, only dependable (it's a directive) of angularJS.
